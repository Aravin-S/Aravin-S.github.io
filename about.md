Hey, I'm Aravin.

I'm a software developer, computer engineering grad, and part-time car whisperer. By day, I wrangle backend code and cloud infrastructure. By night, I’ve been known to revive broken BMWs with nothing but determination, a socket wrench, and an unhealthy amount of YouTube tutorials.

I’ve worked at Bell building backend systems that don’t break (often), and I’ve dabbled in pretty much everything from Python and Java to Docker, Kubernetes, and cloud platforms like AWS and GCP. If it's got an API, I’ll probably try to make it do something it wasn’t meant to.

I love solving problems, learning cool new tech, and making things that actually work (usually on the second try). When I’m not coding or under a car, I’m probably drinking coffee and pretending I’m not thinking about either.

Let’s build something cool—or at least debug it together.
